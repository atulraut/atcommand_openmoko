======

"AT My Command" is an AT Test Suite application that end-users can use
to test AT commands with a front-end. It is to help core developers
get feedback on AT commands on different operators, and regions.

The project website is at:
https://projects.openmoko.org/projects/atmycommand/

It is used to test AT commands on the Neo1973 phone. Uses libgsmd API.

It will take sometime to load the application as it restarts
gsmd. Sometimes it fails to load due to segfault in
lgsm_passthrough(). Just re-run the application to test it.

All logs are present in /var/log/atmycommand. Log names are based on date and time.

Feedback welcome!
